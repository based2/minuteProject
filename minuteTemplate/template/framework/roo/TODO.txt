Comment on the roo console
give a .roo file as input of the console: stop first error otherwise at end.
primary key policy?
enum?
many2many intermediary table?
Explicit name of table for mapping.
roo console field type (mapping to DB type), exhaustive list.

Conventions to resolve ambiguities:
resolve ambiguity for dependencies. Entity A has two ONE_TO_MANY link with Entity B. 
It is not possible to have twice the same variable 'bs' twice. (Compilation uniqueness issue).

is ONE_TO_MANY bidirectional always. (implicit MANY_TO_ONE trigger).
what if we just want unidirectional?

Roo class without version

pom.xml version of hsqldb

--
steps:
>generate (put mvn jdbc jar)
>open roo console inject .roo file
rem: the output is nearly correct (pk policy is to be overwritten, same as version)
>copy src-overwritten into src

>persistence.xml remove hibernate.autoddl...
>change pom.xml to correct hsqldb.jar, version
>mvn package
